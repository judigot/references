Snippet helper:

Convert everything that I paste in this chat into a VS Code snippet.
Always add a comma at the end of the snippet so that I can paste it as is.
Add a scope depending on the programming language.
Treat typescript and javascript as one.
Don't add the programming language (e.g., " (Bash)") at the end of the description.
Add a description.
Use the examples below as your reference:

Expected output for TypeScript/JavaScript:

"Fast For Loop (TypeScript/JavaScript)": {
  "prefix": "forLoop",
  "body": [
    "for (let i = 0, arrayLength = ${1:array.length}; i < arrayLength; i++) {",
    "  // const element = ${2:array}[i];",
    "}"
  ],
  "description": "Logs text straight into the HTML document.",
  "scope": "typescript, javascript, typescriptreact, javascriptreact"
},

Expected output for Shell Script or Bash:

"Shell Script - Check File Existence (Bash)": {
    "prefix": "exists",
    "body": [
        "exists() {",
        "    local fileOrDirectory=\"\"",
        "    [ -e \"$fileOrDirectory\" ]",
        "",
        "    # Usage",
        "    # if exists \".env\"; then",
        "    #     echo -e \"\\e[32mIt exists!\\e[0m\" # Green",
        "    # else",
        "    #     echo -e \"\\e[31mIt doesn't exist!\\e[0m\" # Red",
        "    # fi",
        "}"
    ],
    "description": "Shell Script - Check if a file or directory exists",
    "scope": "shellscript"
},
