**Front-End Application**: The user interface where the user enters their email and password for authentication.

↓

**User (Initiates Authentication Request)**: The user submits their login credentials (email and password) through the front-end application.

↓

**authRoutes.js (Routes: Handle Authentication Endpoints)**: Defines the API endpoints for authentication, such as /login, and directs requests to the appropriate controller.

↓

**authController.js (Controllers: Manage Authentication Requests)**: Receives the login request, extracts the credentials, and calls the authentication service to process them.

↓

**authService.js (Services: Process Authentication Logic)**: Contains the core logic for authentication. Validates the user's credentials and, if valid, generates an authentication token (e.g., JWT (HTTP-Only Cookies)).

↓

**userModel.js (Models: User Data Interaction)**: Interacts with the database to retrieve and validate user information against the provided credentials.

**okenUtils.js (Utils: Token Generation and Validation)**: Utility functions for generating and validating authentication tokens.

**passwordUtils.js (Utils: Password Hashing and Validation)**: Utility functions for secure password hashing and comparison.

↓

**authMiddleware.js (Middleware: Token Validation for Protected Routes)**: Middleware that verifies the authentication token in subsequent requests to protected routes.

↓

**env (Environment Variables: Configuration Settings)**: Stores sensitive configuration data, such as secret keys for token generation, used by various components in the authentication process.

↓

**User (Response: Authentication Token or Error Message)**: The user receives a response from the server, which is either an authentication token upon successful login or an error message if authentication fails.

↓

**Front-End Application (Receives and Processes Response)**: The front-end application receives the server's response. If authentication is successful, it may store the token for future requests, or handle the error message accordingly.
